Charity Bake Sale on Thursday!

Please donate homemade OR store-bought baked goods for Thursday’s charity baked sale. All proceeds will go to Korean Children’s Charity. Don’t forget - no nuts, label ingredients, and label any containers with your child’s name and class. Drop off your baked donations between 8 AM and 10 AM on the first floor. And very importantly, remember to send your child to school with at least ₩2,000 to buy some of the baked goods on sale.
